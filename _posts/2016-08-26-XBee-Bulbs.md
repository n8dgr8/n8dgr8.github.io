Recently I was at Home Depot doing a run for who knows what (this being the third home improvement store of the weekend for me after Menards and Lowes, yes I'm just that cool) and I saw some light bulbs on clearance at the end of an aisle.

Despite being on clearance, they were like nine bucks.

"What makes these so great?" I thought, and had a look.

Oh my gosh!  It had a "ZigBee Certified" label on it!

With my wife distracted by one of our kids, I quietly slipped one of these prizes into the cart and we moved on...


Why would I, a complete and utter cheapskate, be so willing to spend 3/4ths of a dozen of dollars on a mere light bulb?

Well, a few jobs back (look at my profile on LinkedIn if you really care where) my team and I would hook a ZigBee radio up to just about anything.  We had tens of thousands of thermostats wirelessly connected via ZigBee.  Needed a weird sensor somewhere?  Oh, sure!  ZigBee will do the trick!  Would it be good to know if this pipe had hot or cold water running through it?  How about something as simple / stupid as a battery pack, thermistor, and ZigBee radio to let us know whats up?

While being one of the most (if not _the_ most) essentially closed open protocol in existence, it sure did the trick for us.

A true workhorse for us in these tasks was the [Digi XBee] (http://www.digi.com/xbee) radio.  It combines a rugged, versatile design, an easy to understand serial protocol, and low price into a neat little package.

When we needed a way to bridge ZigBee to Ethernet to get data from our mesh out to the rest of the world, an XBee teamed up with another Digi product, the [ConnectME] (http://www.digi.com/products/embedded-systems/system-on-modules/digiconnectme) inside of an ugly black plastic controller was incredibly effective.
